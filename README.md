# 🏥 PH COVID-19 Hospital Forecasting  
**AI-Driven Forecasting of ICU Occupancy in Philippine Hospitals Using Time-Series Modeling**

---

## 📘 Overview  

This repository contains the complete data science workflow for analyzing and forecasting hospital utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines.  
Using **Facebook Prophet**, an AI-based time-series forecasting model, the project predicts ICU occupancy trends from open **Department of Health (DOH)** datasets.  

The notebook performs:  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Descriptive and regional analysis of hospital capacity  
- Predictive modeling using AI (Prophet)  
- Visualization and interpretation for policy insights  

This project demonstrates how **AI can support healthcare capacity management** and pandemic preparedness through open data and reproducible analysis.

## 📊 Dataset Description  

**Key Fields:**  
- `reportdate` – Date of hospital report  
- `icu_o`, `icu_v` – ICU occupied and vacant beds  
- `nonicu_o`, `nonicu_v` – Non-ICU occupied and vacant beds  
- `mechvent_o`, `mechvent_v` – Ventilator usage  
- `region`, `province`, `city_mun` – Geographic identifiers  

**Derived Columns:**  
- `icu_occupancy_rate = icu_o / (icu_o + icu_v)`  
- `nonicu_occupancy_rate = nonicu_o / (nonicu_o + nonicu_v)`  
- `ventilator_usage_rate = mechvent_o / (mechvent_o + mechvent_v)`

## 🤖 AI / Machine Learning Component

The **Prophet model** is the AI core of this project.
It uses additive regression to capture **trend**, **seasonality**, and **holiday effects** in ICU occupancy data.

```python
from prophet import Prophet

model = Prophet(
    daily_seasonality=True,
    yearly_seasonality=True,
    weekly_seasonality=True,
    seasonality_mode='additive'
)
model.fit(train)
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = model.predict(future)
```

Outputs include predicted ICU occupancy (`yhat`) and 95 % confidence intervals (`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`).
