    "# AI-Driven Analysis of Hospital Capacity and COVID-19 Trends in the Philippines (2020–2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This study analyzes hospital capacity utilization in the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) using Department of Health hospital-level data. We examine temporal trends in bed occupancy, identify periods of systemic stress, and apply time-series forecasting to estimate future capacity risks. Results highlight sustained pressure during major infection waves and uneven recovery across regions. These findings provide evidence to support health system preparedness and surge planning.\n"

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This study investigates how hospital capacity in the Philippines responded to COVID-19 case surges between 2020 and 2022. Using publicly available Department of Health (DOH) data, we analyze trends in ICU beds, non-ICU beds, and ventilator utilization, and apply time-series forecasting to anticipate future capacity pressures. The goal is to provide empirical insights that can support health system preparedness and resource planning during public health emergencies.\n"

    "This study analyzes and forecasts COVID-19–related hospital resource utilization in the Philippines using Department of Health (DOH) hospital-level data. The specific objectives are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine hospital occupancy trends (ICU, non-ICU, and mechanical ventilators) from 2020–2022.\n",
    "2. Identify regional variations in healthcare capacity utilization.\n",
    "3. Assess relationships between COVID-19 case severity and hospital load.\n",
    "4. Develop a time-series forecasting model to estimate future ICU occupancy.\n",
    "5. Generate insights to support healthcare resource management and surge preparedness.\n"

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The study follows a structured data science workflow consisting of data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and time-series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data were obtained from the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) COVID-19 Data Drop, which provides hospital-level records on ICU beds, non-ICU beds, and mechanical ventilator utilization across reporting facilities nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing steps included handling missing or invalid values, parsing reporting dates, converting numerical fields to appropriate data types, and engineering derived features such as occupancy rates to support downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory analysis was conducted to summarize hospital utilization patterns over time, compare regional capacity dynamics, and examine severity-based case distributions using descriptive statistics and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Forecasting Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet) was applied to ICU occupancy data to estimate short-term capacity trends over a 30-day horizon. Model performance was assessed using standard error metrics such as RMSE and MAPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Visualization and Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations were generated to illustrate temporal trends, regional comparisons, and forecast projections. These outputs support interpretation of results and communication of key findings.\n"
